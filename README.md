## How it works
Follow the step-by-step instructions to setup the application, connecting to a SQL Database hosted in Azure. Â This provides a Web Application for configuration, and a Windows Service for automated data collection for the tools and projects that you choose.  At a specified frequency, the Service will collect the data from those tools, and store it to your database (no need for additional gateways or connectivity configuration).  Then download a template to build PowerBI Dashboards, preconfigured with queries for each supported tool (in the future, we will provide additional preconfigured Dashboards).

This application, including all data and communication, is maintained within your network; it does not transmit any data externally.
