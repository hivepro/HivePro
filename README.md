## How it works
Follow the step-by-step instructions to setup the application, connecting to a SQL Database hosted in Azure. Â This provides a Web Application for configuration, and a Windows Service for automated data collection for the tools and projects that you choose.  At a specified frequency, the Service will collect the data from those tools, and store it to your database (there is no need for additional gateways or connectivity configuration).  Then download a PowerBI Dashboard template to build and publish reports.

This application, including all data and communication, is maintained within your network (it does not transmit data externally).
